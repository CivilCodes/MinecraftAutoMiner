# MinecraftAutoFarmer
### It auto farms a strip mine at any level while shifted so you won't fall in lava, also you need to have a DIAMOND/NETHERITE pickaxe in each hotbar because the hotbar rotates every 30minutes. (If any other pickaxe you will end up punching cobble)
#### Remove the code pydirectinput.keyDown('shift') if you hit a lot of caves so you don't get stuck on crouch but it will be a bigger risk with lava.

## Installation 

Use the package manager pip to install pydirectinput.

```bash
pip install pydirectinput
```
